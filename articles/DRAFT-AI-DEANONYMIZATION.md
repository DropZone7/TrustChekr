## Sources List

### Peer-Reviewed / Academic
- Style obfuscation via LLM rewriting as defense (peer-reviewed — need exact citation, likely 2024-2025 NLP/security conference)
- De-anonymization attack pipelines in social media (need to locate specific papers)

### Industry Reports
- Deloitte: $40B US fraud projection by 2027 (industry report)
- 456% rise in AI-enabled fraud 2024-2025 (need primary source — likely GASA or similar)

### Government / Regulatory
- FTC consumer fraud data 2024
- FBI IC3 annual report 2023

### News / Case Studies
- Houston father $15K voice clone kidnapping scam (news report — need outlet citation)
- Voice cloning 3-30 second threshold (multiple sources — need strongest)
- 70% cannot distinguish cloned voices (need primary study)

### ⚠️ Source Gaps to Fill (2+ week research period)
- [ ] Primary academic paper on LLM-powered de-anonymization pipelines
- [ ] Peer-reviewed study on voice clone detection accuracy
- [ ] Platform-specific data on scraping prevention effectiveness
- [ ] Consumer survey data on awareness of de-anonymization risks
- [ ] Legal analysis of de-anonymization under Canadian/US privacy law

## Section-by-Section Outline

### 1. Hook / Introduction
- **Framing:** "What changed" — not new concept, but cost collapsed
- Stat: De-anonymizing someone used to cost thousands in investigator time. Now an AI agent can do it for $1-4 in API calls.
- Tone: Factual, not alarmist. "This is real, it's happening, and here's what you can do."

### 2. How It Works: The AI De-Anonymization Pipeline
- Step 1: **Scraping** — AI agents harvest public social media posts, comments, photos, metadata
- Step 2: **Synthesis** — LLMs aggregate fragments into unified profile (name, location, workplace, interests, relationships, schedule)
- Step 3: **Persona crafting** — Build psychological profile: communication style, emotional triggers, trust patterns
- Step 4: **Sentiment scoring** — Identify vulnerability windows (financial stress, loneliness, life transitions)
- Step 5: **Targeted delivery** — Craft and deliver personalized scam matched to victim's profile
- **Key stat:** 456% rise in AI-enabled fraud 2024-2025

### 3. Voice Cloning: Your Voice Is No Longer Yours
- Only 3-30 seconds of audio needed (TikTok, YouTube, voicemail, conference talks)
- 70% of people cannot distinguish cloned from real voices
- **Case study:** Houston father, $15K, cloned son's voice in fake kidnapping
- **Projection:** Deloitte estimates $40B in US fraud losses by 2027

### 4. Why This Is Different From Past Threats
- **Cost collapse:** From $thousands to $1-4 per target
- **Scale:** Automated pipeline can process thousands of targets simultaneously
- **Personalization:** Not generic phishing — crafted specifically for you
- **Cross-platform aggregation:** No single post is dangerous; the combination is

### 5. What Platforms Are Doing (And Why It's Not Enough)
- Rate limiting on profile access and API calls
- Scraping detection systems
- Content nudges and privacy warnings
- Post-processing noise injection on audio/video
- **Gap:** These are reactive and easily circumvented by sophisticated actors

### 6. How to Protect Yourself (Defense Recommendations)
- **Style obfuscation:** Run posts through LLM rewriting before publishing — drops de-anonymization to chance level
- **Audio hygiene:** Limit public audio/video; use platform privacy settings on voice content
- **Compartmentalize:** Different usernames, emails, personas across platforms
- **Family safe word:** Establish verbal password for emergency calls (defeats voice cloning)
- **Verify through second channel:** Any urgent request → hang up and call back on known number
- **Audit your footprint:** Search yourself; see what an AI would find
- **Privacy settings review:** Lock down public profiles, limit friend-of-friend visibility

### 7. Conclusion
- Empowering framing: "The threat is real, but the defenses are straightforward"
- Not about going offline — about being intentional

## Tone Notes
- **Informative + empowering**, NOT fear-mongering
- Avoid: "terrifying," "nightmare," "you're not safe"
- Prefer: "here's what changed," "here's what works," "you have options"
- Audience: general consumer, not security professionals
- Reading level: accessible but not dumbed down
