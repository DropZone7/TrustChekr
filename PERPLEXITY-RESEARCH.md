## Prompt 3: Crypto Safety Deep Dive

### Topic B: Seed Phrase Security

**Core Stats:**
- CAFC: $309M crypto losses (cited as headline)
- 2024 IC3: poor seed handling tied to 20%+ of $9.3B crypto thefts via phishing
- Canadians: extra vulnerability from Interac-linked wallets where scammers phish phrases during "support" calls

**Step-by-Step Protection:**
1. Generate offline — air-gapped devices; write on acid-free paper or titanium plates (Billfodl)
2. Split storage — divide into 3 parts (e.g., 8+16 words) across fireproof safe, safety deposit box, trusted kin; Shamir's Secret Sharing for advanced
3. Passphrase layer — add 13th/25th "hidden" word (BIP39 standard); store separately
4. Test recovery quarterly — wipe device, restore from phrase to confirm integrity
5. Physical only — engrave on metal; avoid photos (EXIF metadata leaks location)

**5 Fatal Mistakes:**
1. Phone screenshot → auto-uploads to iCloud/Google, malware scans gallery → FIX: pencil/paper
2. Cloud/email backup → server breaches (2023 LastPass hack) → FIX: metal backup + geographic split
3. Sharing with "support" → pig butchering endgame, phrase sent to scammer wallet → FIX: verify via official app only
4. Single location → fire/theft wipes everything → FIX: 2-of-3 multisig wallets
5. Digital generators → clipboard poisoning malware swaps addresses → FIX: offline Diceware + BIP39 wordlist

**Advanced:**
- Multi-sig wallets require 2+ keys from separate locations
- Hardware like Trezor with passphrase beats single-seed
- "Decoy wallet" with $50 bait to detect leaks

## Prompt 8: Kijiji & Canadian Rental Scams

### Step-by-Step Scam Process
1. Copy real MLS/Realtor.ca photos + descriptions
2. Post low rent ($1,800/mo downtown condo) with "urgent" note
3. Respond fast, claim "out of country, trustworthy tenant needed"
4. Send forged lease, ID, driver's license (stolen images)
5. Demand first/last ($3,600) via e-Transfer
6. Provide lockbox code or "cleaner hands keys"
7. Block victim; listing stays until flagged

### Stats

- RCMP/CAFC estimate $10M+ yearly rental scams (up 50% post-COVID)
- Toronto Police: 100s of cases in 2025
- BBB: $2K median loss per victim via e-Transfer

### City-by-City Patterns
- **Toronto:** Duplicated MLS as "private" (GTA Rentals scam 2022, 100s victims); fake applications 50%+ (Menkes 2024); $4K+ deposits
- **Vancouver:** Craigslist/Kijiji hybrids targeting newcomers; "out of country" with sales photo dupes; international students
- **Montreal:** Bilingual fakes (French "urgent" phrasing); student basements; pet-friendly bait; Plateau/McGill/Concordia
- **Ottawa:** ShowingTime MLS hacks; family moved in 2021, $4.3K loss, cleaner evicted them
- **Calgary:** Basement suites with stock photos; "utilities included" unrealistically low

- Check Realtor.ca cross-listing

### FB Marketplace vs Kijiji

- More "urgent" due to algorithm; no phone verification required
- Lower rent offers, no viewings

### Student Housing (September Surge)
- UofT/UBC intake: fake off-campus "deals" for freshmen
- $2K deposits vanish; targets internationals
- Bilingual Montreal scams
