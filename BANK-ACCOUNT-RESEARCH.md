## Executive Summary

**Top Pick for a brand-new tech startup CCPC: BMO eBusiness Plan**

Why: $0/month, unlimited electronic transactions, good online banking. Perfect for an early-stage company that does everything digitally. No minimum balance nonsense. You can always upgrade later.

**Runner-up: RBC Digital Choice Business Account** — $6/month, unlimited electronic transactions, 10 free Interac e-Transfers, strong mobile app with AI cash flow insights.

**Dark horse worth investigating: National Bank** — Has a dedicated Technology Sector banking team (NAventures venture capital arm), Hybrid package at $8/month is cheap, and they offer up to $1,313/year in personal banking savings when you bundle business + personal. Alex saw something good here — it's likely the entrepreneur bundle deal.

**For later (when revenue flows): Float Financial** — Earns up to 4% on idle CAD/USD balances, CDIC-insured, corporate cards, QuickBooks/Xero integration. Opens in 1 business day. Best for when you have $50K+ sitting around.

## National Bank

### Overview
National Bank is Canada's 6th largest bank, headquartered in Montreal. Alex noticed something good — likely their **entrepreneur bundle** which saves up to **$1,313/year** on personal banking when you also have a business account.

### Business Account Packages

#### Hybrid Package
- **Monthly fee:** $8
- **Transactions:** 6 included, 2 Interac e-Transfers included
- **Extra transactions:** Pay per use
- **Best for:** Low-volume startups

#### Premium Package
- **Monthly fee:** $95
- **Transactions:** Unlimited
- **Interac e-Transfer:** Unlimited
- **Fee reduction:** $80/month with Platinum Business Mastercard
- **Waiver:** With $80,000 minimum balance
- **Includes:** Batch deposits free, online banking, scanner support

### Why National Bank Stands Out

#### 1. Technology Sector Banking Team
National Bank has a **dedicated technology sector banking group** offering:
- Financing for growth (organic and M&A)
- Exit strategy support (sales, IPOs)
- Cash flow and liquidity management
- FX hedging strategies
- **Introductions to partners in the Canadian tech sector**
- Private wealth management for founders with successful exits

This is rare among Canadian banks — most don't have sector-specific teams for tech at the small business level.

#### 2. NAventures (Corporate Venture Capital)
- National Bank's VC arm investing in early-to-mid stage companies
- Focuses on companies shaping the future of financial institutions
- Also connected to **Portage Ventures** (external VC fund)
- If TrustChekr touches fintech/trust/verification — could be a strategic relationship

#### 3. Entrepreneur Personal Banking Bundle
- Save up to **$1,313/year** on personal banking services
- Requires holding a National Bank business account
- Likely includes fee waivers on personal chequing, credit cards, etc.
- **This is probably what Alex saw** — great deal for bundling business + personal

#### 4. Online Account Opening
- Can start online
- Expert contacts within 1-2 business days to verify identity and activate
- Need to visit branch for debit card pickup
- CDIC-insured deposits in all currencies

### National Bank Verdict
**Worth a serious look.** The tech sector team + NAventures connection + personal banking savings make this compelling. The Hybrid package at $8/month is reasonable for starting out. The main downside: smaller branch network outside Quebec (though online banking is solid).

## Credit Unions

### Desjardins
- Largest credit union group in Canada (Quebec-based)
- **Business accounts available for federal corporations** — not limited to Quebec
- Competitive fees, profit-sharing model
- Strong French-language support
- Less compelling for Ontario-based tech startup unless you have Quebec connections

### Meridian Credit Union
- Ontario's largest credit union
- **Business Advantage Plus Savings:** Competitive interest on idle cash
- Good local service, lower fees than Big 5
- Documents needed: Articles of Incorporation, corporate resolution, director ID
- Worth considering if you value personal service over digital tools

### Innovation Federal Credit Union
- **Business Account Package 2:** $20/month, 50 transactions
- Profit-sharing with members
- Modern digital banking platform
- Federal credit union — available across Canada
- NerdWallet rates it among top business accounts

### Coast Capital Savings
- BC-based, limited Ontario presence
- **Skip unless you move to Vancouver**

### Credit Union Verdict
Credit unions generally offer lower fees and profit-sharing, but weaker digital tools and smaller ATM networks. For a tech startup, the Big 5 or neo-banks are better fits unless you specifically value the community banking model.

## Startup-Specific Programs

### SVB Alternative in Canada
Since Silicon Valley Bank's collapse (March 2023), there's no direct Canadian equivalent. The closest options:
- **National Bank NAventures** — VC arm, tech sector banking team
- **BDC (Business Development Bank of Canada)** — Government bank for entrepreneurs, doesn't offer chequing accounts but provides startup loans and VC
- **RBCx** — RBC's innovation banking arm (targets larger/later-stage tech companies)
- **BMO WMNfintech** — Accelerator for fintech startups

### Accelerator/Incubator Banking Partnerships
Most Canadian accelerators (DMZ, Communitech, MaRS) don't have formal banking partnerships. Banks compete for this business individually.

### Fee Waivers for Early-Stage Companies
- **BMO eBusiness:** Already $0/month — no waiver needed
- **TD:** $200-$400 cash back promos (current)
- **RBC Digital Choice:** Only $6/month — too small to negotiate
- **National Bank Hybrid:** $8/month — minimal
- **Float/Venn:** Already $0 — plus you earn interest

### Accounting Software Integration Summary
| Software | Best Bank Integration |
|----------|----------------------|
| **QuickBooks** | Float, Venn, Wise, RBC, TD, BMO (via bank feeds) |
| **Xero** | Float, Venn, Wise (direct sync); Big 5 via bank feeds |
| **Wave** | All banks via bank feeds (Wave is free accounting software, Canadian-made) |
| **FreshBooks** | Bank feeds from all major banks |

## Documents & Setup Checklist

### What Alex Needs to Bring to Open a Business Bank Account

#### Required Documents for a Federal Corporation (CCPC)

1. **Certificate of Incorporation** (from Corporations Canada)
   - For 17734344 Canada Inc., this was issued when the federal corporation was registered
   
2. **Articles of Incorporation**
   - The founding document filed with Corporations Canada
   
3. **Corporate By-laws**
   - If adopted (standard set usually created at incorporation)
   
4. **Directors' Resolution / Corporate Resolution**
   - Authorizing the opening of the bank account
   - Specifying who has signing authority
   - Most banks provide a template form
   
5. **Notice of Directors** (or Annual Return showing current directors)
   - Lists all directors of the corporation
   
6. **Government-issued photo ID** for all directors/signing officers
   - Driver's licence or passport
   - Two pieces of ID typically required
   
7. **CRA Business Number (BN)**
   - **Critical:** Alex needs this. It's a 9-digit number assigned by CRA.
   - If the corporation was incorporated federally, Corporations Canada may have automatically requested a BN — check the incorporation documents
   - If not assigned yet: Register at [CRA Business Registration Online](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/registering-your-business/register.html) or call CRA at 1-800-959-5525
   - **Banks may open an account without it** but will need it shortly after
   
8. **Proof of business address**
   - Utility bill, lease, or bank statement showing business address
   - Home address is fine for a home-based startup

#### HST Registration
- **Required when:** Revenue exceeds $30,000 over four consecutive calendar quarters OR in a single calendar quarter
- **Voluntary registration:** Can register voluntarily at any time (recommended once you start incurring HST on business expenses — you can claim Input Tax Credits)
- **How:** Through CRA Business Registration Online, same time as getting your BN
- **Recommendation:** Register for HST voluntarily from day one. You'll claim back HST on expenses (hosting, software, equipment) even before you have revenue.

#### Who Needs to Be Present
- All directors who will be signing officers on the account
- If Alex is the sole director, just Alex
- Bring **two pieces of government ID** (driver's licence + passport is ideal)

#### Pro Tips
- **Do the CRA BN registration first** — it can take 1-2 weeks by mail, or same-day online
- **Open the bank account before spending anything** — keeps corporate veil intact
- **Get a separate credit card** in the corporation's name immediately
- Some banks require a **minimum opening deposit** ($1 to $100 typically)

## Steve's Corner: Negotiation Tips for a Former Banker

Steve — here's the inside playbook:

### 1. Timing Your Visit
- **Best time:** Tuesday to Thursday, mid-morning (10-11am). Avoid Mondays (busy) and Fridays (closings).
- **End of quarter** (March, June, Sept, Dec) — advisors have targets to hit. More flexibility.
- **March is RIGHT NOW** — Q1 end. Good timing.

### 2. What to Negotiate
- For a brand-new CCPC with no revenue, there's limited negotiation power. But:
  - **Ask for fee waivers** for the first 12-24 months on any account
  - **Ask about startup packages** not listed online — branches sometimes have discretion
  - **Bundle personal + business** (especially at National Bank — $1,313/year savings)
  - **Credit card annual fee waiver** for year one
  - **Overdraft protection** setup without fees initially

### 3. The Real Play
- **Open a $0 BMO eBusiness account** for day-to-day operations (no negotiation needed — it's free)
- **Also open a National Bank Hybrid account** for the personal banking bundle savings
- **Later, when revenue comes:** Move to Float or Venn for interest earnings on idle cash
- **This costs $8/month total** and gives you two banking relationships

### 4. What Banks Actually Care About
- **Deposits** — They want your money sitting there
- **Credit products** — They want to lend to you eventually
- **Payroll** — If you hire, running payroll through them is sticky
- **Merchant services** — If you process payments, they want that revenue
- **Promise future business** — "We're a tech startup expecting to scale. We want a banking partner who'll grow with us." This works especially well at National Bank's tech team.

### 5. Red Flags to Avoid
- Don't sign up for unnecessary products (overdraft you don't need, business credit line at high rates)
- Avoid long-term GIC commitments just to waive fees
- Don't let them upsell insurance products during account opening
- **Read the fee schedule** — ask for a printed copy. Banks bury fees for things like returned items, stop payments, and wire transfers.

### 6. Branch vs. Online
- For a corporation, most banks still require at least one in-person visit for identity verification
- **BMO and TD** have the most advanced online onboarding for corporations
- **National Bank** requires branch visit for debit card but starts process online
- Bring everything on the first visit — second trips waste time

### 7. The Documents Power Move
- Walk in with **everything organized in a folder**: incorporation docs, by-laws, resolution (use the bank's template from their website), two IDs, CRA BN, proof of address
- Having your act together signals you're serious and saves the advisor 30 minutes of fumbling
- If Alex doesn't have a CRA BN yet, **get it before going to the bank**

---

## Action Plan for Alex

### Immediate (This Week)
1. ✅ Confirm you have your CRA Business Number (BN) — if not, register online NOW
2. ✅ Gather all incorporation documents for 17734344 Canada Inc.
3. ✅ Draft a directors' resolution authorizing bank account opening (templates online)
4. ✅ Register for HST voluntarily (do this with BN registration)

### This Month
5. **Open BMO eBusiness Plan** — $0/month, go to bmо.com/business or visit a branch
6. **Open National Bank Hybrid** — $8/month, explore the personal banking bundle
7. Get a business credit card through whichever bank you prefer

### When Revenue Starts
8. Evaluate **Float Financial** for earning interest on operating cash
9. If international payments needed: Add **Venn** or **Wise** as secondary account
10. Revisit banking setup when monthly transactions exceed 50-100
