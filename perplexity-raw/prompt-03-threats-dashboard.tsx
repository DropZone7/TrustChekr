// PERPLEXITY RAW — Prompt 3: Real-Time Threat Dashboard (/threats)
// Status: SAVED, PARTIAL — header + threat level section received, need campaigns/trends/reports/CTA
// File: src/app/threats/page.tsx
// Known issues:
// - fetch URLs hardcoded to trustchekr.com (need relative or env var)
// - API response shapes may not match our existing endpoints
// - Canadian alerts fallback data is good
// WAITING FOR: rest of JSX (campaigns section, trending chart, community reports, report CTA)
