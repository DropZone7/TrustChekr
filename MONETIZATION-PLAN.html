<p><strong>For Steve | March 1, 2026</strong></p>
<hr />
<h2>How We Make Money</h2>
<p>TrustChekr follows the <strong>freemium + B2B</strong> model. The consumer tool stays free forever — that's how we build the user base, the data, and the brand. Revenue comes from businesses who want our scam detection engine inside their products.</p>
<h3>Revenue Stream 1: Partner API ($49–$499/month)</h3>
<p><strong>What it is:</strong> Businesses send us phone numbers, URLs, emails, or text messages via our REST API. We send back a risk score, threat signals, and recommended actions in milliseconds.</p>
<p><strong>Who pays:</strong>
- Credit unions checking e-Transfers before they leave
- Telecoms flagging scam calls for subscribers
- E-commerce platforms screening seller listings
- Insurance companies assessing fraud claims</p>
<p><strong>Pricing model:</strong>
| Tier | Calls/month | Price | Per-call cost |
|------|-------------|-------|---------------|
| Starter | 1,000 | $49/mo | $0.049 |
| Growth | 10,000 | $199/mo | $0.020 |
| Enterprise | 100,000+ | $499/mo+ | $0.005 |</p>
<p><strong>Why they'd pay:</strong> Building this internally costs $200K+ in security engineers, threat intel feeds, and maintenance. We give them the same result for $49/month.</p>
<p><strong>Revenue potential:</strong> 50 partners × $199 avg = <strong>$119K ARR</strong> in year 1. 200 partners = <strong>$478K ARR</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Revenue Stream 2: White-Label Widget ($500–$2,000/month)</h3>
<p><strong>What it is:</strong> A branded "Check for Scams" button that credit unions, libraries, or banks embed in their website or online banking portal. Looks like their product, powered by our engine.</p>
<p><strong>Who pays:</strong>
- <strong>Central 1 Credit Union</strong> — 190+ credit unions through ONE integration
- Community banks wanting to differentiate on safety
- Public libraries offering digital literacy tools
- Government consumer protection websites</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Per-deployment monthly license based on traffic volume.</p>
<p><strong>Why they'd pay:</strong> Their members get scam protection without the institution building anything. It's a feature they can announce, market, and point to during fraud prevention campaigns.</p>
<p><strong>Revenue potential:</strong> Central 1 alone could be $5K–$15K/month if adopted across their network. 20 individual deployments × $750 avg = <strong>$180K ARR</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Revenue Stream 3: Affiliate Revenue (Immediate)</h3>
<p><strong>What it is:</strong> When users check something and we determine it's risky, we recommend security products they can use to protect themselves further. We earn commission on sign-ups.</p>
<p><strong>First partner: NordVPN</strong>
- Commission: $40–$100 per sale (varies by plan)
- Conversion: 2–5% of users who see recommendation
- At 10K monthly visitors with 3% conversion = 300 sales × $50 avg = <strong>$15K/month</strong></p>
<p><strong>Other affiliate targets:</strong>
- Identity theft protection (Aura, LifeLock)
- Password managers (1Password, Bitwarden)
- Antivirus (Malwarebytes, Bitdefender)
- VPN services (ExpressVPN, Surfshark)</p>
<p><strong>Why this works for us:</strong> We're not selling — we're recommending after the user already discovered a threat. The conversion rate is naturally high because they're scared and motivated.</p>
<p><strong>Revenue potential:</strong> <strong>$60K–$180K ARR</strong> depending on traffic.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Revenue Stream 4: Premium Consumer Features ($4.99–$9.99/month)</h3>
<p><strong>What it is:</strong> Power users and small businesses pay for extra features the free tier doesn't include.</p>
<p><strong>Premium features:</strong>
- Real-time alerts when new scam campaigns match their profile
- API access for personal automation
- Priority scanning (skip the queue)
- Export scan history reports
- Business email/domain monitoring
- Phone number reputation monitoring</p>
<p><strong>Why later, not now:</strong> We need the free user base first. Premium converts at 2–5% of free users. At 100K free users, that's 2,000–5,000 premium subscribers.</p>
<p><strong>Revenue potential:</strong> 3,000 subscribers × $7/mo = <strong>$252K ARR</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Revenue Stream 5: Data &amp; Intelligence Licensing ($5K–$25K/year per client)</h3>
<p><strong>What it is:</strong> As we process more scans, we accumulate anonymized intelligence about scam campaigns, emerging tactics, and geographic patterns. This data is valuable to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Insurance companies (underwriting, claims fraud)</li>
<li>Banks (fraud model training data)</li>
<li>Law enforcement (campaign intelligence)</li>
<li>Academic researchers (fraud trend analysis)</li>
<li>Government (policy and regulation)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What we sell:</strong> Anonymized, aggregated trend reports. Never individual user data.</p>
<p><strong>Revenue potential:</strong> 10 clients × $15K avg = <strong>$150K ARR</strong>.</p>

<h2>The Norton Comparison</h2>
<p>Norton LifeLock charges <strong>$12–$35/month</strong> per user for:
- Identity theft monitoring
- $1M insurance against ID theft
- Dark web monitoring
- VPN included
- Credit monitoring</p>
<p><strong>What TrustChekr offers that Norton doesn't:</strong>
- Real-time scam checking (Norton monitors AFTER the fact)
- Canada-specific detection (CRA, Interac, RCMP patterns)
- Live threat dashboard (Scam Radar — nobody has this)
- Free tier with no account needed
- Screenshot scanning (no need to click suspicious links)
- Romance scam detection with ML classifier
- XRPL blockchain analysis</p>
<p><strong>The insight:</strong> Norton makes $2.8 BILLION per year selling fear. They monitor for damage AFTER it happens. TrustChekr prevents the damage BEFORE it happens. Prevention is more valuable than insurance — we just need to prove it with traction.</p>
<p><strong>Pricing opportunity:</strong> If Norton charges $12/mo and we can prevent the same damage with a $5/mo premium tier, the value proposition is immediate. And our free tier acts as the funnel.</p>

<p><strong>Margin:</strong> At $10K MRR, our operating costs are &lt;1% of revenue. This is a software business with software margins (80-90%+).</p>
<hr />
<h2>Key Metrics to Track</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Monthly Active Users (MAU)</strong> — free tool usage</li>
<li><strong>Scans per day</strong> — engagement depth</li>
<li><strong>API partner count</strong> — B2B revenue</li>
<li><strong>Affiliate conversion rate</strong> — immediate revenue</li>
<li><strong>Premium conversion rate</strong> — consumer revenue</li>
<li><strong>Average Revenue Per Partner (ARPP)</strong> — B2B health</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Bottom Line for Steve</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>The free tool is the moat.</strong> It builds traffic, data, and brand.</li>
<li><strong>B2B partnerships are the money.</strong> Credit unions, telecoms, police.</li>
<li><strong>Affiliate revenue starts immediately</strong> with zero additional development.</li>
<li><strong>Operating costs are negligible</strong> — this is almost pure margin.</li>
<li><strong>The market is massive</strong> — $638M in reported Canadian fraud losses alone, $12.5B in the US.</li>
<li><strong>Nobody else is doing consumer-facing, Canada-first, real-time scam detection.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We're not competing with Norton. We're filling the gap Norton ignores.</p></body></html>
