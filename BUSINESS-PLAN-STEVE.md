# TrustChekr — Business Plan & Investor Update
**Prepared for Steve | March 1, 2026**

---

## Executive Summary

TrustChekr is a consumer-facing scam detection platform that lets anyone check if a text, email, phone number, URL, or crypto address is a scam. Free, private, no account needed. Built in Toronto, federally incorporated as 17734344 Canada Inc.

**The problem:** Canadians reported $638M in fraud losses in 2024. Only 5-10% report. Real losses are in the billions. There's no consumer tool in Canada that helps people check before they click.

**The solution:** Paste something suspicious → get a plain-English risk assessment in seconds. Plus a live Scam Radar showing what's active right now, an AI chat assistant, and a Safety Academy.

**The business:** Free tool builds the audience. Revenue comes from B2B partnerships (credit unions, telecoms, police), affiliate commissions, premium subscriptions, and data licensing. Target: $1M+ ARR within 18 months.

## Competitive Landscape (Honest Assessment)

### What competitors have that we don't
- **Norton LifeLock** ($2.8B revenue): Mobile app, $1M insurance, call blocking, credit monitoring, millions of users, $12-35/mo pricing
- **ScamAdviser** (6.5M monthly users): Mobile app, B2B API, call blocking, established brand
- **McAfee**: Top-rated accuracy in independent testing, enterprise backing
- **Aura** ($2.5B valuation): All-in-one platform, $9-15/mo

### What we have that they don't
- **Real-time Scam Radar** — first in the world
- **Canada-first** — ScamAdviser gets <3% Canadian traffic
- **Free with no account** — Norton/Aura require subscription + personal info
- **Screenshot scanning** — check without clicking
- **XRPL analysis** — first consumer tool
- **Privacy-first** — we store nothing
- **Romance scam ML** — trained classifier
- **Speed** — shipping faster than funded teams

### Our strategic position
We're not trying to beat Norton at their game. We're filling the gap they ignore: Canada, prevention (not monitoring), free access, and privacy. By the time they notice us, we'll have the Canadian market locked.

## The Bottom Line

TrustChekr is live, working, and differentiated. The Canadian market has no real competitor in consumer scam detection. The product is built. The corporation exists. The grant pipeline is real. The revenue model has 5 distinct streams.

The question isn't whether this can make money. It's how fast we can acquire partners and users. Every week that passes, more Canadians get scammed — and more of them would have used TrustChekr if they'd known about it.
