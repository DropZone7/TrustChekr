**Applicant:** 17734344 Canada Inc. (operating as TrustChekr)
**Date:** March 1, 2026

---

## 1. Project Summary

**17734344 Canada Inc.** (TrustChekr) is a federally incorporated Canadian-Controlled Private Corporation (CCPC), incorporated February 28, 2026, seeking CanExport SMEs funding to accelerate export of its consumer scam detection platform into the United States and Mexico.

TrustChekr is a consumer-facing SaaS platform that combines **real-time scam detection** with **interactive fraud education**. The platform enables everyday consumers to identify, understand, and avoid scams through 121 detection rules, 9 OSINT investigation modules, and 10 interactive academy modules — covering the full spectrum of fraud threats across North America.

**What makes TrustChekr unique:**
- **Already trilingual and multi-market:** Country-specific detection rules for Canada (CRA, Interac), the United States (IRS, Zelle, Venmo), and Mexico (SAT), with guidance in English and Spanish and French localization infrastructure ready
- **First consumer tool with XRPL scam analysis:** Integrates blockchain intelligence for cryptocurrency fraud detection on the XRP Ledger
- **No direct Canadian competitor:** No other Canadian-built platform offers consumer-facing, multilingual scam detection with integrated education
- **Cloud-native architecture:** Built with Next.js, TypeScript, and deployed on Vercel — zero physical export barriers, instant global availability

The requested funding will support targeted trade show participation, digital marketing campaigns in the US and Mexico, Spanish-language localization of education content, and US trademark protection — all time-bound, measurable activities aligned with Canada's trade diversification strategy and National Cyber Security Strategy.

## 2. Export Readiness

TrustChekr is not a concept or prototype — it is **live, production-deployed, and already serving all three North American markets**.

### Current Production Status
- **121 detection rules** with country-specific coverage:
  - Canada: 37 rules (CRA scams, Interac fraud, CAFC-reported schemes)
  - United States: 21 rules (IRS impersonation, Zelle/Venmo fraud, FTC-reported schemes)
  - Mexico: 14 rules (SAT impersonation, bank fraud, remittance scams)
  - Shared/cross-border: 17 rules (phishing, romance scams, crypto fraud)
- **9 OSINT modules** for real-time scam investigation
- **10 academy modules** for interactive fraud education
- Guidance available in **English and Spanish**
- **French localization ready** via next-intl internationalization framework

### Why Export Barriers Are Minimal
- **Cloud-native SaaS** hosted on Vercel — no physical goods, no shipping, no customs
- **Country-specific rules already built** — incremental cost to add markets is near-zero
- **Scalable infrastructure** — same codebase serves all markets simultaneously
- **No regulatory licensing required** — consumer education tool, not a financial service

### Strategic Alignment
- **Canada's National Cyber Security Strategy:** Consumer fraud prevention is a stated priority
- **Cybersecurity as strategic export:** Canadian cybersecurity exports exceed **$1.15 billion annually**, with **72.5% directed to the United States**
- **Trade diversification:** Mexico represents a high-growth, underserved market for cybersecurity tools

## 3. Market Opportunity

### United States
- **Largest fraud market globally:** FTC reported **$12.5 billion** in consumer fraud losses in 2024
- IRS impersonation alone: $9.14M in direct losses, $789M in total government imposter fraud
- Zelle processed $806B in 2023 with ~$725M in fraud losses
- CFPB documented $870M in losses at three major banks (2017-2024)
- **No consumer-facing detection tool** combines real-time analysis with education

### Mexico
- Cybersecurity market valued at **$3.12 billion in 2026**
- Growing at **11.43% CAGR** to reach **$5.36 billion by 2031**
- Rapidly digitizing financial sector with increasing fraud exposure
- Limited consumer-facing fraud prevention tools available in Spanish

### Competitive Landscape

The consumer scam detection market includes well-funded global players:

| Competitor | What They Offer | Users | Pricing | Gap TrustChekr Fills |
|-----------|----------------|-------|---------|---------------------|
| **ScamAdviser** | Website trust scoring, call blocking, B2B API | 6.5M/month | Free + API plans | No Canadian-specific rules (CRA, Interac), no interactive education |
| **Norton LifeLock** | AI scam detection, $1M identity insurance, credit monitoring, dark web monitoring | Millions | $12-35/month | US-centric, no Canadian/Mexican rules, expensive paywall, no education modules |
| **McAfee Scam Detector** | AI text analysis (top-rated in independent testing) | Millions | Part of McAfee suite | No screenshot support, no country-specific guidance, no education |
| **Trend Micro ScamCheck** | AI-powered scam and call analysis | Millions | Part of security suite | Character limits, false positives on legitimate messages, no trilingual coverage |
| **Aura** | All-in-one identity protection, real-time scam detection, VPN, antivirus | 1M+ | $9-15/month | No interactive education, no Canadian-specific detection, identity focus not scam education |
| **CAFC** | Fraud reporting, static advisories | N/A (government) | Free | No real-time detection, PDF-based education only |

**TrustChekr's differentiation is specific, not universal.** Major security companies offer AI scam detection within $12-35/month security suites, but none provide:
- **Canadian-specific detection rules** (CRA impersonation, Interac e-Transfer fraud, Big 5 bank patterns)
- **Trilingual North American coverage** (Canada, US, Mexico with country-specific guidance and reporting hotlines)
- **Interactive consumer education** (10 quiz-based modules with 61+ real-world scenarios)
- **Cryptocurrency scam analysis** including XRP Ledger native support
- **Free, accessible entry point** designed for seniors and non-technical users who won't purchase a full security suite

TrustChekr fills a gap between enterprise-grade fraud tools (Sift, Feedzai — $200K+/year B2B) and expensive consumer security suites — providing accessible, country-specific scam protection for the underserved majority who need help but won't pay $15/month for it.
