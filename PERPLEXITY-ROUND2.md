## Prompt D — Zelle/Venmo Fraud Research (Expanded)

### Legal Actions — Full Detail
- **NY Attorney General vs EWS:** $1B+ lawsuit filed August 2025
  - Defendant: Early Warning Services LLC (owned by JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Capital One, PNC, Truist, US Bank)
  - Allegation: Zelle launched without adequate fraud protections despite known risks
  - Claims: $1B+ in consumer losses from fraud and scams on the platform
- **CFPB vs Zelle/EWS:** Case filed December 2024
  - Alleged $870M in losses at three major banks (2017-2024)
  - Case withdrawn/dismissed early 2025 under new CFPB leadership
  - Significance: Regulatory uncertainty for P2P platforms

### Accidental Transfer Scam — Step-by-Step
1. Scammer sends money to victim via Zelle (funds from a stolen/compromised account)
2. Scammer contacts victim claiming "I accidentally sent you money"
3. Asks victim to "return" the money via Zelle to a different account
4. Victim sends their own money to scammer's account
5. Original transfer is reversed by the bank (because source account was compromised)
6. Victim loses the amount they "returned" — no recourse under Reg E (authorized transaction)

### Bank Impersonation Scam — Step-by-Step
1. Victim receives text alert: "Did you authorize a Zelle payment of $500? Reply YES or NO"
2. Victim replies NO
3. Scammer calls victim, spoofing bank's phone number
4. Claims to be bank fraud department, references the text alert
5. Instructs victim to send money to "themselves" via Zelle to "secure" the account
6. Provides a phone number or email linked to scammer's Zelle account
7. Victim sends money believing they're protecting their account
8. Money goes to scammer; bank classifies as "authorized" transaction

### Regulation E (EFTA) Rules
- **Unauthorized transactions:** Bank must reimburse if reported within 60 days
  - $0 liability if reported within 2 business days
  - Up to $50 liability if reported within 2-60 days
  - Unlimited liability after 60 days
- **Authorized transactions (scams):** No Reg E protection
  - If the consumer initiated the transfer, even under false pretenses, banks have no legal obligation to reimburse
- **Key distinction:** "Unauthorized" = someone accessed your account without permission. "Authorized" = you sent the money yourself (even if tricked)

### Zelle Network Rule Changes (Late 2023)
- Zelle/EWS implemented new rules requiring member banks to reimburse victims of certain impersonation scams
- Covers scams where criminals impersonate the victim's bank
- Does not cover all scam types (e.g., romance scams, purchase scams)
- Banks must reimburse qualifying claims within specific timeframes
- Effectiveness debated: Critics say scope too narrow

### Venmo Fake Screenshots
- Scammers use edited payment screenshots to "prove" payment was sent
- Screenshots show completed transaction that was never actually made
- Common in marketplace transactions (Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist)
- Venmo's pending payment feature exploited: Payment shown but not yet cleared
- Mitigation: Always verify payment received in your own Venmo app, never rely on sender's screenshot

### Cash App — CFPB Penalty
- **$175 million total:** $120M consumer redress + $55M civil penalty
- Block Inc. (Cash App parent) failed to investigate fraud claims
- Inadequate customer support: Users unable to reach humans for dispute resolution
- Failed to protect users from unauthorized transactions

### Interac e-Transfer Comparison (Canada)
- **Zero-liability policy:** Interac guarantees consumers are protected from unauthorized transactions
- **$16.5M bank investigator fraud (2024):** Scammers posed as bank investigators, convinced victims to send Interac e-Transfers to "secure" accounts
  - Similar pattern to US bank impersonation scams
  - Key difference: Canadian banks reimbursed under zero-liability policy
- **Autodeposit:** Reduces interception risk (no security question needed)

### EFTA vs Interac Zero Liability — Analysis
| Feature | US (EFTA/Reg E) | Canada (Interac) |
|---|---|---|
| Unauthorized txn protection | Yes (tiered by reporting time) | Yes (zero liability) |
| Authorized scam protection | No legal requirement | Zero liability covers most cases |
| Reporting window | 2-60 days (tiered liability) | Reasonable timeframe |
| Impersonation scam coverage | Voluntary (Zelle 2023 rules) | Covered under zero liability |
| Consumer burden of proof | Consumer must prove unauthorized | Bank investigates |
| Regulatory enforcement | CFPB (currently weakened) | FCAC + Interac network rules |

**Key takeaway:** Canadian consumers have significantly stronger P2P fraud protection than US consumers. The Interac zero-liability model is a stronger consumer protection framework than Reg E.

## Prompt E — De-Anonymization Research

### ETH Zurich Paper
- **arXiv:** 2602.16800 (pre-print, not yet peer-reviewed)
- **Title:** Large Language Model-Based De-Anonymization
- **Institution:** ETH Zurich
- **Status:** Pre-print (February 2025)

### Methodology
- Uses LLMs to de-anonymize authors from writing style analysis
- **Open-world setting:** Identify whether a text belongs to any author in a known set, or to an unknown author
- **Closed-world setting:** Identify which specific author from a known set wrote a given text
- Combines stylometric features with LLM reasoning capabilities
- Tests across multiple LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, open-source models)

### Key Results
- **68% recall at 90% precision** in closed-world authorship attribution
- Significantly outperforms traditional stylometric methods
- LLMs can identify subtle writing patterns humans cannot detect
- Performance degrades gracefully with larger candidate pools

### Limitations
- Pre-print status: Not yet peer-reviewed
- Dataset limitations: Tested on specific corpora (Reddit, academic papers)
- Language: Primarily English-language evaluation
- Adversarial robustness: Style obfuscation (e.g., LLM rewriting) significantly reduces accuracy
- Ethical concerns: Dual-use technology with privacy implications
- Computational cost: Requires significant LLM inference resources

### External Commentary
- Privacy researchers flagged concerns about weaponization for doxxing
- Cybersecurity community noted implications for whistleblower protection
- Style transfer/obfuscation identified as effective countermeasure
- Debate over responsible disclosure of de-anonymization techniques
- Relevance to TrustChekr: Could be used to detect fraudulent accounts using writing style analysis, or conversely, to protect user privacy through style obfuscation features
