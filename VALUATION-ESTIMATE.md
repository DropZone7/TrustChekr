## Method 1: Cost-to-Recreate (Floor Value)

What would it cost to hire people to build what exists today?

| Component | Estimated Hours | Rate (CAD) | Cost |
|-----------|----------------|------------|------|
| 20,704 lines of production TypeScript | 400-600 hrs | $150/hr | $60,000-$90,000 |
| 121 scam detection rules (research + writing) | 80-120 hrs | $175/hr | $14,000-$21,000 |
| 15 SEO articles (journalism quality) | 60-90 hrs | $125/hr | $7,500-$11,250 |
| 10 academy modules (61+ scenarios) | 80-100 hrs | $125/hr | $10,000-$12,500 |
| 9 OSINT API integrations | 60-80 hrs | $175/hr | $10,500-$14,000 |
| Security audit + patching | 20-30 hrs | $200/hr | $4,000-$6,000 |
| Research corpus (7.7M test rows, ETL) | 40-60 hrs | $150/hr | $6,000-$9,000 |
| UI/UX design + accessibility | 60-80 hrs | $125/hr | $7,500-$10,000 |
| Infrastructure (Vercel, DNS, CI/CD) | 15-20 hrs | $150/hr | $2,250-$3,000 |
| Domain (trustchekr.com) | — | — | $500-$1,000 |
| **TOTAL COST-TO-RECREATE** | **815-1,180 hrs** | | **$122,250-$177,750** |

**Floor value: ~$125K-$175K CAD**

This is what a consulting shop would charge to build this from scratch. It's the absolute minimum — it doesn't account for the research, market knowledge, or strategic positioning.

## Method 2: Comparable Startup Valuations (Pre-Revenue)

Canadian cybersecurity/consumer protection startups at similar stage:

| Comparable | Stage | Valuation | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-----------|-------|
| Cybersecurity SaaS (pre-revenue, MVP) | Seed | $500K-$2M | Standard Canadian seed range |
| RegTech/compliance startups | Pre-seed | $750K-$3M | Regulatory moat = premium |
| Consumer fintech (fraud prevention) | Seed | $1M-$5M | High multiples for fraud/security |
| ScamAdviser (estimated) | Mature | $10-15M ARR | Our closest comp, but we have more features |

**Pre-revenue cybersecurity SaaS with working product: $500K-$2M CAD** is typical at Canadian incubators (MaRS, Cybersecure Catalyst, DMZ).

## Method 3: What Raises the Valuation

### Multipliers (things that make TrustChekr worth MORE)

| Factor | Impact | Why |
|--------|--------|-----|
| **Working product** (not just an idea) | +50-100% | 29 pages live, scan engine works |
| **XRPL native analysis** (first-mover) | +25-50% | No competitor has this |
| **North American coverage** (3 countries) | +25-50% | Addressable market = 500M people |
| **Canadian-first data moat** | +25% | Nobody else owns this niche |
| **Interactive education** (academy) | +15-25% | Engagement + retention differentiator |
| **CCPC structure** (SR&ED eligible) | +10-15% | 43% tax credit on dev costs = investor-friendly |
| **Fundable** ($545K-$925K accessible) | +10-20% | De-risks the investment |
| **Telegram bot** | +5-10% | Distribution channel |
| **7.7M row test corpus** | +5-10% | Validation infrastructure |

### Risks (things that lower it)

| Factor | Impact | Why |
|--------|--------|-----|
| Pre-revenue | -30-50% | No proven monetization yet |
| Solo founder | -10-20% | Investor concern (bus factor) |
| No user metrics | -10-20% | No MAU/DAU/retention data yet |
| Free hosting tier | -5% | Signals early stage |

---

## Method 4: SR&ED Value

Your development costs are immediately valuable as SR&ED credits:

| Cost Type | Amount (est.) | Credit (43% CCPC) |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| Your time (if salaried) | Needs salary on books | 43% of salary |
| Contractor costs (if any) | — | 43% |
| Cloud/API costs | Minimal so far | 43% |
| **Key insight** | Every hour of dev work is worth 43 cents on the dollar back from CRA |

If you put yourself on payroll at $60K/year and file SR&ED: **$25,800/year back in cash refunds** from CRA. This is real money that funds runway.

## My Honest Estimate

| Scenario | Valuation (CAD) | Basis |
|----------|----------------|-------|
| **Conservative** (cost-to-rebuild) | $150K-$200K | What the code is worth today |
| **Fair** (comparable pre-revenue SaaS) | $500K-$1M | What an angel investor might pay |
| **Optimistic** (with traction + funding) | $1M-$2.5M | Post-CanExport, post-Catalyst, first users |
| **Stretch** (partnership + revenue) | $3M-$5M | Central 1 deal or white-label contract |

### What Gets You to $1M+
1. **First 1,000 users** — proves demand
2. **CanExport grant** — $75K non-dilutive validates the business
3. **Central 1 Forge acceptance** — 190 credit unions = distribution
4. **First revenue** (NordVPN affiliate, API access) — proves monetization
5. **Cybersecure Catalyst** — Canada's stamp of approval

### What Gets You to $5M+
1. **10,000+ monthly active users**
2. **$10K+ MRR** from any source
3. **Bank partnership** (even one)
4. **Government contract** (CAFC, provincial consumer protection)
5. **Media coverage** (one CBC or Globe & Mail story)

---

## Bottom Line

**Today, right now: $500K-$1M CAD** is a defensible valuation for what exists.

You have a working product, a federal corporation, three countries of coverage, no direct competitor in Canada, and $545K+ in accessible non-dilutive funding. That's not a side project — that's a real company with a moat.

The gap between $500K and $5M is traction. Users, revenue, partnerships. The product is built. Now it needs to be sold.
