## 4. Business Bank Account for Federal CCPC (17734344 Canada Inc.)

### Documents Alex Needs

1. **Articles of Incorporation** (from Corporations Canada — Alex should have this from federal incorporation)
2. **Certificate of Incorporation** (the official document with corp number 17734344)
3. **Corporate Resolution / Board Resolution** — authorizing who can open and operate the account (Alex can draft this himself as sole director)
4. **Personal ID** — Government-issued photo ID (driver's license or passport)
5. **CRA Business Number (BN)** — Strongly recommended before opening. Get one at: canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/registering-your-business.html
6. **Proof of business address** — Utility bill or lease in business name (home address is fine for startups)

### How to Get a CRA Business Number

- **Online:** Through CRA Business Registration Online (BRO) at canada.ca — takes ~5 minutes, instant BN
- **Phone:** 1-800-959-5525
- **You need it for:** HST collection (mandatory once revenue exceeds $30K in 4 consecutive quarters), payroll, corporate tax filing
- **Do this FIRST** before going to the bank — most banks want it

### Bank Comparison

| Bank | Monthly Fee | Free Transactions | Online Opening | Best For |
|------|------------|-------------------|----------------|----------|
| **RBC Digital Choice** | $6.95/mo | 15/mo | Yes (in-branch signing may be required) | Established brand, wide branch network |
| **TD Basic Business** | $0 (first year promo often available) | Limited | In-branch required | Longest branch hours in Canada |
| **BMO Business Builder** | $3.95/mo | 10/mo | Partial (appointment needed) | Low starting cost |
| **Scotiabank Basic Biz** | $0-$4.95/mo | Varies | In-branch | Good if Alex already banks there |
| **CIBC Smart Business** | $6/mo | 10/mo | Partial | Corporate account features |
| **Wealthsimple Business** | $0 | Unlimited | **Fully online** | Zero fees, no branch needed |
| **KOHO Business** | $0 | Unlimited | **Fully online** | Prepaid model, cashback |
| **Float** | $0 | Unlimited | **Fully online** | CDIC-insured, earn up to 4% |
| **Venn** | $0 | Unlimited | **Fully online** | Built for startups, automation |

### Recommendation for Alex

**Best path:** Open a **Wealthsimple Business or Float** account online immediately (no branch visit, zero fees, good for a pre-revenue startup). Then open an **RBC or TD** account later when you need branch banking, credit products, or business loans. Many startups run dual accounts.

**Can you open fully online?** Neo-banks (Wealthsimple, Float, Venn) = YES. Big 5 banks = mostly NO, need at least one in-branch visit for corporations.

## 5. Canadian Trademark Registration (TrustChekr)

### Trademark vs Copyright — What Alex Needs

| | Trademark | Copyright |
|---|-----------|-----------|
| **Protects** | Brand names, logos, slogans used in commerce | Original artistic/literary works |
| **For TrustChekr** | The word "TrustChekr" + the logo as brand identifiers | The specific artwork/design of the logo |
| **Registration** | Required (via CIPO) | Automatic on creation (registration optional) |
| **Alex needs** | **BOTH** — but trademark registration is the priority |

**Bottom line:** File a trademark for "TrustChekr" (word mark). If the logo is distinctive, also file a design mark. Copyright on the logo is automatic.

### CIPO Registration Process & Timeline

1. **Search** the Canadian Trademarks Database (done below)
2. **File application** online at CIPO — ~15 minutes
3. **Examination** — Currently ~7.8 months wait (as of late 2025)
4. **Publication** — If approved, published for 2 months for opposition
5. **Registration** — If no opposition, registered
6. **Total timeline:** **12-18 months** for straightforward applications

### CIPO Database Search: "TrustChekr"

I attempted to search the CIPO trademark database. The search interface requires interactive form submission. **Alex should search directly:**
- Go to: https://ised-isde.canada.ca/cipo/trademark-search/srch
- Search "TrustChekr" and "Trust Chekr" and "TrustChecker"
- Look for similar marks in Nice Classes 9, 42, 45

**Likelihood of conflict:** Low — "TrustChekr" is a distinctive coined spelling. But search for "TrustCheck" and "Trust Check" variations.

### Costs

| Route | Filing Fee | Registration Fee | Total |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| **DIY (1 class)** | $478.15 (2025) | $289.19 | **~$767** |
| **DIY (2 classes)** | $478.15 + $145.12 | $289.19 | **~$912** |
| **Lawyer** | $1,500-$3,000+ (includes fees) | Included | **$2,000-$3,500** |

### Nice Classes Needed

- **Class 9** — Downloadable software; mobile apps; computer software for security/fraud detection
- **Class 42** — Software as a service (SaaS); computer security services; providing online non-downloadable software
- **Class 45** — Security consulting services (optional, but worth considering)

**Recommend filing Classes 9 and 42 minimum.**

### Should Alex File in the US (USPTO)?

**YES — but not immediately.** If TrustChekr is targeting US users:
- USPTO filing fee: ~$250-$350 per class (TEAS standard/plus)
- Can file based on "intent to use" (before actual US commerce)
- Consider filing within 6 months of CIPO filing to claim priority date
- **Total US cost DIY:** ~$750 for 2 classes
- **Total US cost with lawyer:** $2,000-$4,000

**Priority:** File Canada first. File US within 6 months to preserve priority.

| **Location** | Vancouver Convention Centre, BC |
| **2026 Dates** | May 11-14, 2026 (already announced) |

### Ticket Prices (2026 — 2025 event has already occurred by now)

⚠️ **Important Note:** The 2025 Web Summit Vancouver (May 27-30, 2025) is 3 months away from now (March 2026). **It already happened.** The next one is **May 11-14, 2026**.

For 2026:

| **Executive** | C$1,895 (excl. tax) |
| **Chairperson** | C$38,095 (excl. tax) |

### Startup Program (ALPHA equivalent)

## 7. Finding an Accountant

### What to Look For

- **CCPC experience** — understands small business deduction, passive income rules
- **SR&ED specialist or partnership** — either they do it in-house or have a dedicated SR&ED partner
- **Startup-friendly** — won't charge $500/hr for basic bookkeeping questions
- **Cloud accounting** — uses Xero, QuickBooks Online, or Wave
- **Proactive tax planning** — not just filing, but structuring (salary vs dividends, HST optimization)

### SR&ED Specialist vs General Accountant

- **General accountant:** Does your T2 return, bookkeeping, HST. Cost: $1,500-$4,000/yr for a startup
- **SR&ED specialist:** Prepares the technical narrative + financial claim. Often works on **contingency** (25-30% of the refund, no upfront cost)
- **Best approach:** Get a general accountant for books/tax + a separate SR&ED firm on contingency

### Expected Costs

| Service | Cost Range |
|---------|-----------|
| Annual T2 corporate tax return | $1,000-$2,500 |
| Monthly bookkeeping | $200-$500/mo |
| HST filing (quarterly) | $100-$300/quarter |
| SR&ED claim preparation | 25-30% of refund (contingency) OR $3,000-$8,000 flat |
| Initial setup/consultation | $200-$500 |

### 3-5 Firms/People to Contact (Toronto Area)

1. **GTA Accounting** (gtaaccounting.ca) — Toronto-based, explicitly covers startup tax strategies and SR&ED for CCPCs
2. **Gondaliya CPA** (gondaliyacpa.ca) — Toronto, specializes in startup accounting, CCPC expertise, affordable corporate tax filing
3. **G6 Consulting** (g6consulting.ca) — Toronto SR&ED specialists, **no cost until you get paid** (contingency model). Great for the SR&ED claim specifically.
4. **WTC Chartered Accountants** (wtcca.com) — Toronto, corporate tax for CCPCs, SR&ED experience
5. **Avalon Accounting** (avalonaccounting.ca) — Vancouver-based but works remotely, known for startup-friendly approach (backup option)

### When Does Alex Need One By?

- **Fiscal year end:** Your corporation's first fiscal year end is set by you — typically 12 months after incorporation. Check your Articles of Incorporation.
- **First T2 filing:** Due 6 months after fiscal year end
- **HST registration:** **Mandatory once revenue exceeds $30,000 in any 4 consecutive calendar quarters.** Can voluntarily register earlier (recommended — allows ITCs on expenses)
- **SR&ED claims:** File with your T2, so same deadline
- **Recommendation:** Get a basic accountant **now** (before March 2026 tax season rush). Get SR&ED specialist when you're ready to file first claim.
